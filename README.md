Instructions: Try to get four of your game pieces in a row before your opponent does. Four in a row in a column, row or diagonally is acceptable. Game pieces can only be placed on the bottom row or on top of another game piece.

Future Enhancements: Improved/higher level css and a scoreboard to keep track of the winners is yet to come!
